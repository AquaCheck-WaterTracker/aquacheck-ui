# Aqua Check - Water Tracker

Aqua Check is a bootcamp final project. This project took me only two weeks to complete. There are still many features that can be added in future sprints. 
The web project is about saving the intake of water you drink per day. The user can also define a goal, edit it and delete it. In the navbar there are also two sections with tips and links to interesting articles.
Backend and Frontend are separate projects.
